If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could
It doesn't hurt me
Do you want to feel how it feels?
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
See, if I only could
You don't want to hurt me
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
C'mon, baby, c'mon darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon angel, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let's exchange the experience
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon angel
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon angel
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon angel
C'mon, c'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
